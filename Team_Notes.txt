This is just a initial idea of how we could organize the project, feel free to mess around with it.

Player turn/color is always represented as White = true, Black = false

I set board locations with [file][rank] since that is how moves are usually described verbally eg. A4
--> A = 0, B = 1, ... , G = 6, H = 7

Piece names/types are currently represented as strings, although using an Enum could also be an option

I also included separate folders for the business and user/presentation layers for organization purposes

Piece_Classes is a subfolder of the business layer for readability, but may end up not being the best strategy
